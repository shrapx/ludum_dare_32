# Ludum Dare 32: Robot Restores Nature

### Theme: An Unconventional Weapon

In a Future where trashed robots roam a ruined planet, where nothing grows, A robot discovers a lost secret. Nature is waiting below the surface. The robot uses his hose to spread water, which unlocks nature. The idea was to use nature as a weapon, and for all other robots to be broken and malfunctioning, and for them to hinder your progress at unleashing Nature. I did not fit any other bots into the 48 hours, So it becomes a more reflective game where the reaction of the world is the players reward.
